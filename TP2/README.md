Optimizing Distribution Under Budget and Distance Constraints :

The goal of this assignment is to design an optimal delivery route starting from a distribution center and connecting as many sales points as possible to maximize revenue. The route must respect three constraints: a maximum budget, a distance limit between each point and the center, and full connectivity of the network around the center.
