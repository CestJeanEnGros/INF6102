Graph Community Clustering :

Given social network data from various regions, each represented as an undirected graph where nodes are individuals and edges indicate social relationships. The task is to partition each graph into cohesive groups of individuals (clusters), such that each person belongs to exactly one group, and members of the same group are directly connected (except for single-person groups).

The goal is to maximize the cohesion quality of your groupings â€” a score that reflects how strongly connected individuals are within each group compared to across different groups. High cohesion means your clusters are well-formed and socially meaningful, which makes them valuable for targeted market analysis.
