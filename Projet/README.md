Eternity II: Advanced Puzzle Solving with Local Search and Metaheuristics :

This project focuses on solving a simplified version of the Eternity II puzzle, a famously difficult 16Ã—16 edge-matching puzzle. Each tile has a colored pattern on each side and must be placed such that adjacent tiles share the same edge color. Tiles can be rotated, and border edges must match a special "border" color. The task is to design an innovative algorithm using heuristics, local search, or metaheuristics to find high-quality solutions. 

Every usefull information (full description of the task, how to run, ...) are inside the Assignement pdf (french only sorry). The presentation and description of my implmentation can be read in the Report pdf (french only too).
